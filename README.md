# Plantico
This is a univerity project for a course about Scrum. 
The main focus is to work as a Scrum-Team by developing an application for a self selected projectidea.
In this project the idea is to develope a Application where you can Search for plants, add them to your own list andget reminded whe you have to water your plant.

## Project-Setup
For setup you just have to open the application in AndroidStudio.
For developing the application you may have to also create a Emulated Device. For best UI Experience use a Pixel 5 with API 31.
Then just run the application with the Play-Button in Android Studio after selecting a device to run on.
